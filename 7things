7 things I wish i had Known

(There are actually ten but I've only got time for the first 7)


1.  be very careful when you pause, cos ometimes it isn't coming back. Note that a scale is a Pause followed by a restore

2.  HEAP (REBUILD ALL after truncating a HEAP) (load lots of stuff and it'll hurt) The database will expand like a middle aged man

3.  Workgroup management use multiple logins in your ADF
	Watch out for long running returns
	you can reconfigure during the day

4.  ADF (lets run that lots of times) (singleton pattern)

5.  Concurrency will kill you (stop faffing about with the small fry settings) everyone forgets this

6.  Backps/restores (who what, why when how, BKP sproc, ext BKP sproc)

7.  Random network failures RETRY is your friend
	(also running out of temp DB) 

8.  materialise the DMV's 
	(deploys on busy environments are hard) 
	rebuilding indexes/stats

9.  ragged snowflake joins are bad bad bad bad bad

10.	NVARCHAR(MAX) is a LEAD boot

11. Don't distribute on a column you update! Seriously this is really really bad!

12. Don't replicate like a crazy person

13. Don't forget you can cluster stuff (CCI isn't the answer to everything)

14. Use a TEMP schema for CTAS

15. CETAS is just awesomely fast and Databricks loves those Parquet files
